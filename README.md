# DIP-Thresholding

# Image Enhancements: 
* Sometimes microscope images lack contrast, they appear to be washed out but they still contain information.
* (Show scratch assay and alloy images)
* We can mathematically process these images and make them look good,
* More importantly, get them ready for segmentation
* Histogram equalization is a good way to stretch the histogram and thus improve the image.
